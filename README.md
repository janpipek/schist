# schist
Physt (Python histograms) reimplemented in Scala.

See <https://github.com/janpipek/physt> for details.

**WARNING:** Although one day this may become a usable library, currently I am using it just to practice the 
basics of Scala.

Already working:

```scala
h = cz.vzdusne.schist.example.normalH1()
cz.vzdusne.schist.ui.plot(h)
```
